# Scout

This is the Scout app. It connects to services provided by [spotseeker_server](https://github.com/uw-it-aca/spotseeker_server).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

* Docker
* Docker-compose
* git

### Intallation and Set Up

First, clone the repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/uw-it-aca/scout.git


If you wish to change the default settings, navigate to the repository and copy the sample environment variables into your own `.env` file:

```
cd scout
cp sample.env .env
```

Optionally, add custom 404 response to `docker/urls.py`:

```
handler404 = 'scout.views.custom_404_response'
```

## Development

Run the following command to build your docker container:

```
docker-compose up --build
```

### Running Unit Tests with Docker
